Functional analysis studies the goals of the product, how the product will be used, and the expectations the customer has of the product once it leaves the project and moves into operations. Functional analysis may also consider the cost of the product in operations, which is known as life-cycle costing.
funding limit<>Most projects have a determined budget in relation to the project scope. There may be a qualifier on this budget, such as plus or minuspercent based on the type of cost estimate created.
interviews<>A requirements collection method used to elicit requirements from stakeholders in a one-on-one conversation.

stakeholder analysis<>A scope definition process where the project management team interviews the stakeholders and categorizes, prioritizes, and documents what the project customer wants and needs. The analysis is to determine, quantify, and prioritize the interests of the stakeholders. Stakeholder analysis demands quantification of stakeholder objectives; goals such as good, satisfaction, and speedy arent quantifiable.
systems analysis<>A scope definition approach that studies and analyzes a system, its components, and the relationship of the components within the system.
systems engineering<>This project scope statement creation process studies how a system should work, designs and creates a system model, and then enacts the working system based on the projects goals and the customers expectations.

This estimating approach starts at the bottom of the project and considers every activity, its predecessor and successor activities, and the exact amount of resources needed to complete each activity.
control account<>A WBS entry that considers the time, cost, and scope measurements for that deliverable within the WBS. The estimated performance is compared against the actual performance to measure overall performance for the deliverables within that control account. The specifics of a control account are documented in a control account plan.
control threshold<>A predetermined range of acceptable variances, such as +/ percent off schedule. Should the variance exceed the threshold, then project control processes and corrected actions will be enacted.
crashing<>A schedule compression approach that adds more resources to activities on the critical path to complete the project earlier. When crashing a project, costs are added because the associated labor and sometimes resources (such as faster equipment) cause costs to increase.
critical path<>The path in the project network diagram that cannot be delayed, otherwise the project completion date will be late. There can be more than one critical path. Activities in the critical path have no float.
discretionary dependencies<>These dependencies are the preferred order of activities. Project managers should use these relationships at their discretion and should document the logic behind the decision. Discretionary dependencies allow activities to happen in a preferred order because of best practices, conditions unique to the project work, or external events.

fast tracking<>A schedule compression method that changes the relationship of activities. With fast tracking, activities that would normally be done in sequence are allowed to be done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast tracking can be accomplished by changing the relation of activities from FS to SS or even FF or by adding lead time to downstream activities. However, fast tracking does add risk to the project.

management reserve<>A percentage of the project duration to combat Parkinsons Law. When project activities become late, their lateness is subtracted from the management reserve.
mandatory dependencies<>These dependencies are the natural order of activities. For example, you cant begin building your house until your foundation is in place. These relationships are called hard logic.
monte Carlo analysis<>A project simulation approach named after the world-famous gambling district in Monaco. This predicts how scenarios may work out, given any number of variables. The process doesnt actually churn out a specific answer, but a range of possible answers. When Monte Carlo analysis is applied to a schedule, it can examine, for example, the optimistic completion date, the pessimistic completion date, and the most likely completion date for each activity in the project and then predict a mean for the project schedule.
parametric estimate<>A quantitatively based duration estimate that uses mathematical formulas to predict how long an activity will take based on the quantities of work to be completed.
parkinsons Law<>A theory that states: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. It is considered with time estimating, because bloated or padded activity estimates will fill the amount of time allotted to the activity.
planning package<>A WBS entry located below a control account and above the work packages. A planning package signifies that there is more planning that needs to be completed for this specific deliverable.

resource calendars<>Calendars that identify when project resources are available for the project work.
resource-leveling heuristic<>A method to flatten the schedule when resources are overallocated. Resource leveling can be applied using different methods to accomplish different goals. One of the most common methods is to ensure that workers are not overextended on activities.
rolling wave planning<>The imminent work is planned in detail, while the work in the future is planned at a high level. This is a form of progressive elaboration.
schedule management plan<>A subsidiary plan in the project management plan. It defines how the project schedule will be created, estimated, controlled, and managed.
soft logic<>The activities dont necessarily have to happen in a specific order. For example, you could install the light fixtures first, then the carpet, and then paint the room. The project manager could use soft logic to change the order of the activities if so desired.
start-to-finish<>An activity relationship that requires an activity to start so that its successor can finish. This is the most unusual of all the activity relationship types.
start-to-start<>An activity relationship type that requires the current activity to start before its successor can start.
subnet<>A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for outsourced portions of projects, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also called a fragnet.
template<>A previous project that can be adapted for the current project and forms that are pre-populated with organizational-specific information.

work package<>The smallest item in the work breakdown structure.
actual cost (AC)<>The actual amount of monies the project has spent to date.
analogous estimating<>An approach that relies on historical information to predict the cost of the current project. It is also known as topdown estimating and is the least reliable of all the cost-estimating approaches.
bottom-up estimating<>An estimating approach that starts from zero, accounts for each component of the WBS, and arrives at a sum for the project. It is completed with the project team and can be one of the most timeconsuming and most reliable methods to predict project costs.
budget estimate<>This estimate is also somewhat broad and is used early in the planning processes and also in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate can be frompercent to + percent.
commercial database<>A cost-estimating approach that uses a database, typically software-driven, to create the cost estimate for a project.
contingency reserve<>A contingency allowance to account for overruns in costs. Contingency allowances are used at the project managers discretion and with managements approval to counteract cost overruns for scheduled activities and risk events.
cost aggregation<>Costs are parallel to each WBS work package. The costs of each work package are aggregated to their corresponding control accounts. Each control account then is aggregated to the sum of the project costs.
cost baseline<>A time-lapse exposure of when the project monies are to be spent in relation to cumulative values of the work completed in the project.
